    <h1 class="my-4">About us</h1>
    <p>In 2015, three childhood friends—Turbo, Baga, and Luca—embarked on an entrepreneurial journey that would transform the agricultural industry. Growing up in a small rural town, they had always been fascinated by farming machinery and the way technology could enhance agricultural productivity. With backgrounds in engineering, business, and web development, they decided to combine their skills to create something groundbreaking.
    <br>
    It all started with a simple observation: farmers in their region struggled to find high-quality tractors and farming equipment at competitive prices. Traditional dealerships were expensive, and online marketplaces were cluttered with unreliable sellers. Turbo, who had experience working on his family's farm, knew the pain firsthand. Baga, a sharp-minded businessman, saw an opportunity in the market, while Luca, a skilled programmer, believed an online solution could bridge the gap.
    Determined to make a difference, they pooled their savings, rented a small office, and began building their platform. They named it Harvest Hub, a user-friendly website where farmers could buy and sell tractors, spare parts, and other agricultural equipment with confidence. The platform featured detailed product descriptions, verified seller profiles, and secure payment options, ensuring transparency and trust in every transaction.
    <br>
    At first, they faced skepticism. Farmers were hesitant to shift from traditional purchasing methods to an online marketplace. To earn their trust, the trio traveled across the country, attending agricultural fairs, meeting farmers, and explaining the benefits of Harvest Hub. They also partnered with reputable manufacturers and dealerships to ensure high-quality listings.
    Their hard work paid off. Within a year, Harvest Hub gained traction, attracting thousands of users. Word spread quickly, and soon, even large-scale agricultural businesses started using the platform. By 2018, Harvest Hub had expanded beyond national borders, becoming a leading name in the agricultural e-commerce sector.
    <br>
    Today, Turbo, Baga, and Luca's vision continues to thrive. Their passion for agriculture and technology has not only changed the way farmers buy equipment but has also empowered small-scale farmers with access to affordable machinery. Harvest Hub stands as a testament to their determination, proving that with the right mix of passion, innovation, and perseverance, even the most traditional industries can be revolutionized.
